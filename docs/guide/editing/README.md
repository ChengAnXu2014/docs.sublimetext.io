Sublime Text is brim-full of editing features. This topic just
scratches the surface of what's possible.

## Multiple Selections

Multiple selections let you make sweeping changes to your text efficiently.
Any praise about multiple selections is an understatement. This is why:

Select some text and press <Key k="Ctrl + D" /> to **add more** instances. If
you want **to skip the current instance**, press <Key k="Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D" />.

If you go too far, press <Key k="Ctrl + U" /> to **deselect** the current instance.


## Transforming Multiple Selections into Lines

<Key k="Ctrl + L" /> expands the selections to the end of the line. 
<Key k="Ctrl + Shift + L" /> splits the selections into lines.

You can copy multiple selected lines to a separate buffer, edit them there,
select the content again as multiple lines and then paste them back into
place in the first buffer.


## Column Selection

You can select a rectangular area of a file. Column selection makes use of
multiple selections.

It's possible to add blocks of text to or remove them from the selection.

### Using the Mouse

**Windows & Linux**

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Select Block          | <Key k="⇧ + Right Mouse Button" />        |
| Add to Selection      | <Key k="Ctrl + ⇧ + Right Mouse Button" /> |
| Remove from Selection | <Key k="Alt + ⇧ + Right Mouse Button" />  |

**OS X**

| Description           | Shortcut                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |

### Using the Keyboard


| System  | Shortcut                                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | <Key k="Ctrl + Alt + Up" /> and <Key k="Ctrl + Alt + Down" /> |
| Linux   | <Key k="Alt + ⇧ + Up" /> and <Key k="Alt + ⇧ + Down" />       |
| OS X    | <Key k="^ + ⇧ + Up" /> and <Key k="^ + ⇧ + Down" />           |


## Other Ways of Selecting Text

The list is long; all available options can be found under **Selection**. To
name a few:

* Select subwords (<Key k="Alt + Shift + ←/→" />)
* Expand selection to brackets (<Key k="Ctrl + Shift + M" />)
* Expand selection to indentation (<Key k="Ctrl + Shift + J" />)
* Expand selection to scope (<Key k="Ctrl + Shift + Space" />)


## Transposing Things

Need to swap two letters or, better yet, two words? Experiment with
<Key k="Ctrl + T" />.


## And much, much more...

The **Edit**, **Selection**, **Find** and **Goto** menus are good places to
look for handy editing tools. You might end up using just a few of them,
but the rest will still be there for when you need them.
